# GlassFish Docker Images

This repository contains the Docker image for Oracle GlassFish 3.1.2.2, based on the official Oracle images at [oracle/docker-images](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images).

Converis 5.8 and 5.9 require GlassFish 3.1.2.2, but Oracle only provides images for GlassFish 4.1.1 and up. The GlassFish image here is based on 4.1.1, but downgraded for 3.1.2.2.
